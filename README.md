### Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict car prices using machine learning models. Car prices can be influenced by various factors including brand goodwill, features, horsepower, and mileage. In this project, we explore Linear Regression and Ridge Regression to build and evaluate predictive models.

Features
- Year: The year of manufacture of the car.
- Driven_kms: The total kilometers driven by the car.
- Present_Price: The current market price of the car.
- Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
- Selling_type: Type of selling (e.g., Dealer, Individual).
- Transmission: Transmission type (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- Owner: Number of previous owners.

Data Preprocessing
Load Data: Data is loaded from car data.csv.
Label Encoding: Categorical variables (Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission) are encoded into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Features are scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the data.
Train-Test Split: Data is divided into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).

Model Training
Linear Regression: Trained on scaled training data.
Ridge Regression: Trained with an alpha value of 1.0 on scaled training data.

Summary and Analysis
Model Effectiveness: Both Linear and Ridge Regression models demonstrate strong performance with an RÂ² of 0.85, indicating a good fit to the data. The slight difference in MSE suggests that regularization has minimal impact on performance.
Feature Scaling: Scaling ensures that features contribute equally, improving the stability and performance of the models.
Predictions: Both models provide consistent and realistic price predictions for new data.
