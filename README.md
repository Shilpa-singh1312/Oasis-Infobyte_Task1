Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using machine learning models. The price of a car is influenced by various factors such as the brand's goodwill, car features, horsepower, and mileage. In this project, we use Linear Regression and Ridge Regression to model and predict car prices. This project provides an excellent opportunity to learn how to train and evaluate car price prediction models.
